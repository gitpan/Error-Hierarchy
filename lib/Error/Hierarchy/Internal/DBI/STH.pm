=head1 NAME

Error::Hierarchy::Internal::DBI::STH - DBI statement-related exception

=head1 VERSION

version 1.101690

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is part of the DBI-related exceptions. It is internal and you're
not supposed to use it.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 transmute_exception

Transmute the exception according to a two-level hash where the keys are DBI
exception's C<err> and C<errstr> and the value is an exception class name.

If no match is found, the exception is not changed. If a match is found, the
exception is blessed to the new package and returned.

=head2 TRANSMUTED_EXCEPTION

An inherited hash - see C<every_hash()> in L<Data::Inherited> - that defines
the mappings for C<transmute_exception()>.

=head1 PROPERTIES

This exception class inherits all properties of
L<Error::Hierarchy::Internal::DBI::H>.

It has the following additional properties.

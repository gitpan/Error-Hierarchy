=head1 NAME

Error::Hierarchy::Internal - Base class for internal exceptions

=head1 VERSION

version 1.100980

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class implements the base class for internal exceptions. All internal
exceptions should subclass it. However, you probably shouldn't throw an
exception of this class; rather use
L<Error::Hierarchy::Internal::CustomMessage>.

This class is important so applications can define their own internal
exceptions (opposed to business exceptions) and just catch objects of this
class where appropriate.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 is_optional

Returns 0, so this exception is not optional.

=head2 stringify

Defines how an exception should look like if it is used in a string: The same
as L<Error::Hierarchy>, but it prepends the package, filename and line the
exception occurred in to the given message.

=head1 PROPERTIES

This exception class inherits all properties of L<Error::Hierarchy>.

It has no additional properties.

=head1 INSTALLATION

See perlmodinstall for information and options on installing Perl modules.

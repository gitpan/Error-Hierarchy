=head1 NAME

Error::Hierarchy::Mixin - Provides often-used exception-related methods

=head1 VERSION

version 1.102720

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package MyClass;
  use Error::Hierarchy::Mixin;

  Some::Exception->throw(foo => 'bar');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This mixin provides several methods that you will often use when dealing with
exceptions.

It also overrides C<CORE::GLOBAL::die()> so C<die()> will produce an
L<Error::Hierarchy::Internal::CustomMessage>. If you have to use the original
C<die()>, use C<CORE::die()> instead.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 throw

Takes an exception class name (a string) and a hash of arguments. Loads the
exception class, constructs an exception object, passes it the arguments and
throws it by calling the exception object's C<throw()> method. It populates
the UNIVERSAL namespace, so all packages get this ability.

=head2 record

Like C<throw()>, but records the exception using the exception object's
C<record()> method.

=head1 INSTALLATION

See perlmodinstall for information and options on installing Perl modules.

=head1 NAME

Error::Hierarchy - Support for hierarchical exception classes

=head1 VERSION

version 1.102500

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Error::Hierarchy::ReadOnlyAttribute;

    use warnings;
    use strict;

    use base 'Error::Hierarchy';

    __PACKAGE__->mk_accessors(qw(attribute));

    use constant default_message => '[%s] is a read only attribute';

    use constant PROPERTIES => ( 'attribute' );

# Meanwhile...

    package main;

    use Error::Hierarchy::Mixin;

    sub foo {
        if (@_) {
            Error::Hierarchy::ReadOnlyAttribute->
                throw(attribute => 'foo');
        }
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides support for hierarchical exception classes. It builds upon
L<Error> and is thus compatible with its C<try>/C<catch> mechanism. However,
it records a lot more information such as the package, filename and line where
the exception occurred, a complete stack trace, the hostname and a UUID.

It provides a stringification that is extensible with any properties your own
exceptions might define.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 depth

Get or set the caller depth, that is the number of call stack frames that are
skipped when reporting the package, filename and line the error was thrown
from. When an exception object is constructed, it defaults to 0. This is
useful if you want to throw an exception from the perspective of your own
caller. For example:

    sub assert_foo {
        unless ($teh_foo) {
            throw SomeException(depth => 1);
        }
    }

Without the C<depth> argument, the exception would show that it was thrown
within C<assert_foo()>. Maybe that's what you want, but with C<depth()> you
can make it appear as if the exception was thrown from the place where
C<assert_foo()> was called from.

The actual exception depth is influenced by C<error_depth()> as well.

=head2 error_depth

Like C<depth()>, but here the value should be defined within the exception
class code itself. Therefore, you can't set the value, but subclasses can
override it. Some exceptions should always be thrown from the caller's
perspective (or even higher up); use C<error_depth()> for this case. C<depth()>
by contrast is intended for the user to be set; the two are added together to
get the actual depth. In this class the C<error_depth()> defaults to 1 so the
exception is at least reported from the place where it was actually thrown - a
value of 0 would mean that the exception is reported as having occurred
L<Error::Hierarchy> itself, which is probably not what you want.

If you override this value in a subclass, it's probably a good idea to add the
subclass' desired depth to the superclass's depth to accumulate it. For
example:

    package MyException;
    use base 'Error::Hierarchy';
    sub error_depth {
        my $self = shift;
        1 + $self->SUPER::error_depth();
    }

=head2 comparable

Support for L<Data::Comparable>.

=head2 init

Initializes a newly constructed exception object.

=head2 get_properties

Actual exception classes will subclass this class and define properties.
Exception classes themselves can be subclassed. So this method returns the
inherited list of all the exception class' properties.

=head2 properties_as_hash

Constructs a hash whose keys are the exception's properties - see
C<get_properties()> - and whose values are the values of each property in the
exception object. The properties C<package>, C<filename> and C<line> are
omitted.

In list context, the hash is returned as is. In scalar context, a reference to
the hash is returned.

=head2 stringify

Defines how the exception should look if the object is stringified. This class
inherits from L<Error::Hierarchy::Base>, which overloads C<""> to call
C<stringify()>.

This class stringifies an itself by taking the C<message()> attribute and
passing it to C<sprintf()>, along with the exception's properties.

=head2 transmute($exception, %args)

Transmutes an existing exception. It leaves the stack trace, filename, line
etc. as it is and just blesses it into the class on which C<transmute()> was
called, adding the given additional arguments. This is used when catching a
generic exception and turning it into a more specific one.
